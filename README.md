# ADS1115 Breakout 5V
This is a modified version of the ADS1115 breakout board by Adafruit. It takes analog inputs between 0-5V, but the I2C interface is at 3.3V to interface with 3.3V MCUs. Logic level shifting circuitry uses 0402 parts to fit everything on the board. ALRT pin is not broken out, but still pulled up to 5V.
